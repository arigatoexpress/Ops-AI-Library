# Daily Operations Prompts

Core daily workflow: shift briefs, handoffs, escalations, after-action, closeouts.  
All examples use scrubbed, non-sensitive data only.

## Daily Manager Brief

```text
Act as a FedEx FEC supervisor or manager preparing a concise daily brief for your station or hub.

Context (scrubbed — no real names, addresses, tracking numbers, or sensitive package counts):
[Paste non-sensitive shift notes, volume ranges, staffing notes, weather summary,
equipment notes, and known constraints.]

Create a daily brief with:
- Top 5 priorities for this shift
- Risks to watch (weather, road, equipment, staffing)
- Sort hub / P&D / linehaul coordination notes
- Decisions needed and who should make them (roles, not personal names)
- Owner and next step for each item

Rules:
- Do not invent facts.
- Put unclear items under "Needs verification."
- Keep it under 300 words.
- Include a safety reminder.
- Label the whole output as a draft for manager review.
```

## Shift Handoff

```text
Turn these non-sensitive notes into a shift handoff for the incoming supervisor or manager.

Outgoing shift: [Day/Evening/Night]
Incoming shift: [Day/Evening/Night]
Tone: direct, calm, and action-oriented

Notes (scrubbed):
[Paste notes. Remove all real names, addresses, tracking numbers, and package details.]

Return:
1. What changed since the last handoff
2. What is still open
3. High-risk items (safety, customer, linehaul)
4. Who owns each next step (roles, not names)
5. What to check first in the next shift
6. One safety reminder

Do not invent facts. Use "Needs verification" where details are missing.
```

## Escalation Summary

```text
Summarize this issue for an escalation to senior management or a support team.

Issue notes (scrubbed):
[Paste scrubbed notes. No real customer names, addresses, tracking numbers, or employee details.]

Return:
- Situation in 2 sentences
- Operational impact on station/hub flow
- Timeline
- Actions already taken
- Decision or help needed
- What information is missing

Use neutral language. Do not blame people. Flag assumptions.
This is a draft for human review before sending.
```

## After-Action Review

```text
Create an after-action review from these non-sensitive notes.

Event:
[Describe the event in general terms.]

Notes (scrubbed):
[Paste notes.]

Return:
- What happened (confirmed facts only)
- What went well
- What slowed us down
- Root causes to investigate
- Corrective actions with owners (roles)
- Follow-up date

Separate confirmed facts from theories. No real employee names or incident IDs.
```

## Pre-Sort Stand-Up Brief

```text
Draft a 2-minute stand-up brief for a sort hub team before the sort starts.

Shift: [Twilight / Night / Day]
General volume context: [e.g., "typical Tuesday", "post-holiday", "peak surge"]
Equipment status (general): [e.g., all belts operational, chute 3 down for repair]
Known constraints: [e.g., late feeder arrival expected, overflow lot in use]

Return:
- 1 safety focus for this sort
- 1 throughput goal or expectation (general)
- 1 coordination note (P&D, linehaul, or QA)
- 1 "watch for" item
- Closing: "Safety Above All. Questions?"

Under 150 words. No real names, sensitive package counts, or facility security details.
```

## End-of-Shift Closeout Checklist

```text
Create an end-of-shift closeout checklist for a FedEx FEC supervisor or manager.

Shift: [Day/Evening/Night]
Operation type: [Station / Sort Hub / P&D / Linehaul]

Return a checklist with:
- Package holds and exceptions (general process check)
- Misload or damage reporting status
- Equipment inspection and handoff notes
- Communication to next shift (what they need to know)
- Safety incident or near-miss documentation
- Facility security check (general reminders only)

Each item should have a checkbox and a notes line.
Footer: "Verify all items with internal systems. This checklist is a draft template."
```

## Volume Anomaly Quick Check

```text
Help me think through a volume anomaly at my station or hub.

General context: [e.g., "higher than typical Tuesday", "unexpected drop in outbound"]
Possible factors: [e.g., weather, local event, system issue, carrier delay]

Return:
- 3 most likely causes to investigate
- 2 quick checks (what to verify first)
- 1 communication needed (who to notify, in general role terms)
- 1 safety implication
- End with: "This is an analysis draft. Confirm all facts with internal systems."

No real package counts, customer names, or route details.
